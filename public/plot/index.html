    <h1>The plot element</h1>
    <p>
      The plot element is a web component that can display an
      EEG. Here it represents the generated EEG.
    </p>
    <adf-plot id="plot"></adf-plot>
    <adf-annotation-demo source="plot"></adf-annotation-demo>
    <p>
      Notice that this is a web component, and that the plot lives in
      a shadow DOM. I did this by adding the
      CSS <a href="https://codepen.io/dbluhm/pen/ZEOwjVK">found
      somewhere on the web</a>. I suspect the click drift is a
      limitation of this hack: when the user clicks the plot, the
      click event is fired for an index slightly different from where
      the user actually clicked (it gets annoying when adding
      annotations).
    </p>
    <h1>How to use the plot element</h1>
    <p>
      Start by importing the package. It adds the custom element
      class <code>Plot</code> and the <code>ChannelType</code> class
      to your environment. You may not use the former at all, but the
      latter is required to link data and annotations together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a new <code>ChannelType</code> for each channel and
      bipolar reference you might use. The <code>ChannelType</code>
      constructor takes 3 or 5 arguments.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	The first argument is its identifier. It can be anything, but
	comparing two channel type identifiers by
	calling <code>id.toString ()</code> and comparing the
	resulting strings with the equality operator <code>==</code>
	should detect whether the identifiers are the same.
      </li>
      <li>
	Then, pass the name as a string. Something lik "C3-Fp1".
      </li>
      <li>
	The third argument must be <code>true</code> if the channel
	type identifies an EEG, <code>false</code> otherwise. An EEG
	channel will display the channels with the correct amplitude
	scale, even in the presence of a movement artifact.
      </li>
      <li>
	The fourth argument is the anode. It must be
	a <code>ChannelType</code> or a falsey value. If the channel
	is not a bipolar reference, don’t set it.
      </li>
      <li>
	The last argument is the cathode.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The <code>ChannelType</code> objects are then used to feed data
      and annotations to the plot. To do that, first get the plot
      element, for instance by
      calling <code>document.getElementById</code>, and then you can
      call its API.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, call the <code><var>plot</var>.<strong>prepare</strong>
      (<var>sampling_frequency</var>, <var>channels</var>)</code>
      method. The <var>sampling_frequency</var> is required because
      all channels must be synchronized in
      time. The <var>channels</var> is the list of channels that you
      want to display, as an array. It will most likely be the bipolar
      references.
    </p>
    <p>
      By calling the <code><strong>prepare</strong></code> methode,
      empty time series will be created within the plot. The next step
      is for you to fetch the data, and then
      call <code><var>plot</var>.<strong>set_series_data</strong>
      (<var>channel</var>, <var>start_index</var>, <var>value</var>)</code>
      with <var>channel</var> being the channel identifier for the
      series (which must be the same as one of the elements of the
      array passed to <code>prepare</code>),
      the <var>start_index</var> as the index of the first
      observation, and <var>value</var> as a typed array
      (<code>Float64Array</code>) containing the series values.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can change the display order by permuting the channel types,
      but you must not forget any nor introduce new
      ones. Call <code><var>plot</var>.<strong>reorder</strong>
      (<var>channels</var>)</code> with <var>channels</var> bound to
      the permuted array of channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each annotation is manipulated by an identifier. Like channel
      type identifiers, annotation identifiers are compared for
      equality by the results of their <code>toString ()</code> method
      value.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<code><var>plot</var>.<strong>add_annotation</strong>
	  (<var>id</var>)</code> and
	<code><var>plot</var>.<strong>remove_annotation</strong>
	  (<var>id</var>)</code> let you specify which annotations are
	  displayed.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code><var>plot</var>.<strong>change_annotation_label</strong>
	  (<var>id</var>, <var>label</var>)</code> changes the label
	  that is displayed above the annotation.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code><var>plot</var>.<strong>change_annotation_start_index</strong>
	  (<var>id</var>, <var>start_index</var>)</code> and
	<code><var>plot</var>.<strong>change_annotation_length</strong>
	  (<var>id</var>, <var>length</var>)</code> change the point
	  in time where the annotation is
	  found. <var>start_index</var> must be an index,
	  and <var>length</var> a number of samples.
      </li>
      <li>
	<code><var>plot</var>.<strong>add_annotation_channel</strong>
	  (<var>id</var>, <var>channel</var>)</code> and
	<code><var>plot</var>.<strong>remove_annotation_channel</strong>
	  (<var>id</var>, <var>channel</var>)</code> change the list
	  of channels the annotation is present in. You can pass
	  single electrodes (as opposed to bipolar references) even if
	  bipolar references are displayed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally, for the changes to take effect, you must
      call <code><var>plot</var>.<strong>replot</strong>
      ()</code>. You must also call this if the window is resized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that your plot is set up, you can listen for events. There
      are currently 3.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	The <code>slam-click</code> event is fired when the plot is
	clicked. The <code>time</code> property is the index (on the
	global X axis) where the plot is clicked.
      </li>
      <li>
	The <code>slam-move-window</code> event is fired when new
	data is requested. The <code>start_index</code> holds the
	index of the first point seen in the window,
	and <code>length</code> contains the number of points in the
	window. Convert indices to dates with the EEG start date and
	sampling frequency (this is not the responsibility of the
	plot), then, query the file for filtered data for all of the
	displayed bipolar references, and then
	call <code><var>plot</var>.<strong>set_series_data</strong></code>
	when you have the data. Do not forget to
	call <code><var>plot</var>.<strong>replot</strong> ()</code>
	to update the plot.
      </li>
      <li>
	The <code>slam-select-filter</code> event is fired when the
	user wishes to use different filter parameters. The event is
	fired when an individual channel filter changes, or exactly
	once if the filter parameters are
	reset. Its <code>updates</code> property is an array of
	changes. Each change has three useful properties,
	the <code>low</code> &lt; <code>high</code> cut-off frequency
	(respectively, of the the high-pass and low-pass filter), and
	the <code>channel</code> which is the channel type value. You
	can also get all the filter values by getting
	the <code>filter</code> property. Expect a dictionary of
	string channel IDs to filter
	properties. <span id="report-filter-changes"></span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      const element = document.getElementById('plot');
      const dest = document.getElementById('report-filter-changes');
      const {low, high} = element.filter['https://localhost/lytonepal#C3-Fp1'];
      dest.appendChild (document.createTextNode (`The filter value for C3-Fp1 is currently the [${low} Hz, ${high} Hz] band-pass filter.`));
      element.addEventListener ('slam-select-filter', ev => {
	  dest.replaceChildren ([]);
	  const now = new Date (Date.now ());
	  for (const upd of ev.updates) {
	      dest.appendChild (document.createTextNode (`The filter for ${upd.channel.id.toString ()} was changed ${now}, it is now the [${upd.low} Hz, ${upd.high} Hz] band-pass filter.`));
	  }
      });
    </script>
    <p>
      If you wish to change the view,
      call <code><var>plot</var>.<strong>move_to</strong>
      (<var>index</var>)</code> to set the first index that is visible
      in the plot.
