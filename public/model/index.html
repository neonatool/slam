    <h1>First step: Load an EEG file!</h1>
    <p>
      EEG files, with the <em>.adf</em> extension, contain the raw
      sensor data and any RDF metadata that we want. The first step is
      for you to find such a file on your system and load it in!
    </p>
    <adf-file-picker id="file-picker"></adf-file-picker>
    <h1>Second step: Browse the file metadata!</h1>
    <p>
      The EEG embeds different kinds of metadata. For instance, it
      gives you the <em>start date</em> and <em>sampling
      frequency</em> of the EEG.
    </p>
    <adf-metadata-summary source="file-picker"></adf-metadata-summary>
    <p>
      However, this is only an example. You can query whatever
      metadata you want. For that, you need to specify
      the <em>subject</em>, which can be the EEG
      itself <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, and <em>predicate</em>, which must
      be an IRI reference, such as:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://neonatool.github.io/slam/ontology/lytonepal.en.html#start-date"
	 >https://neonatool.github.io/slam/ontology/lytonepal.en.html#start-date</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the simplest data pattern that you can match against the
      dataset, but there are others.
    </p>
    <adf-explorer source="file-picker"></adf-explorer>
    <h1>Third step: Filter the sensor data!</h1>
    <p>
      Usually, only a small window of the data needs to be filtered at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would define the <em>start</em> and <em>stop</em>
      dates of the EEG, the <em>low</em> and <em>high</em> cut-off
      frequencies of the band-pass filter, and you would get a nice
      view of the filtered signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plotting the data is not the goal of this demonstration, so here
      you just get the first 20 seconds of the data, filtered between
      0.3 and 30 Hz, as a CSV file.
    </p>
    <adf-filter-demo source="file-picker"></adf-filter-demo>
    <h1>Fourth step: Update the metadata!</h1>
    <p>
      Yes, you can add your own metadata to the EEG file. You must
      simply set the <em>subject</em>, the <em>predicate</em> as an
      IRI reference surrounded by angle brackets, and
      the <em>object</em> in the N3 format.
    </p>
    <h2 id="uses">What does it mean to use an EEG for this
    demonstration?</h2>
    <p>
      This example application uses a file. You just picked it in Step
      1 of this document. You are browsing its data and metadata right
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, if you wanted to insert in the file that it is
      used in this demonstration program, you would set the following
      information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	the <em>subject</em> would be this application,
	<code>&lt;<adf-demo-this-iri></adf-demo-this-iri>&gt;</code>;
      </li>
      <li>
	the <em>predicate</em> would be the idea to use a
	file <a href="#uses">as we defined it just
	above</a>, <code>&lt;<adf-demo-uses-iri></adf-demo-uses-iri>&gt;</code>;
      </li>
      <li>
	the <em>object</em> would be the thing that has been used, and
	for simplicity reasons, we will declare that it
	is <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <adf-insert-demo source="file-picker"></adf-insert-demo>
    <p>
      You can also remove metadata from the file. More specifically,
      you would mark some metadata to be obsolete, by setting an
      expiration date flag. In most cases, the expiration date is the
      current date, so you can leave it unset and it will do what you
      want.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this demonstration program, the deletion date is the date
      when you clicked the delete button. Please note that in general,
      if you request to delete a pattern with no subject, no
      predicate, and no object, it means that you want to delete every
      metadata of the file. Which is probably not what you want. As a
      result, this demonstration program will not do anything if more
      than one field is missing.
    </p>

    <h1>Fifth step: Download the modified file!</h1>
    <p>
      Once you have modified the file, you can download it with the
      new data inserted.
