    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://plmlab.math.cnrs.fr/neonatool/bevue/bevue-app">Slam</a>
      is a web application to read and annotate ElectroEncephaloGraphy
      data. It is meant to be used by clinicians to indicate
      biomarkers that are usually searched to diagnose anoxo-ischemy.
    </p>
    <h1>Problem</h1>
    <p>
      To show how the application works, we need an EEG file. However,
      those are very hard to find, because they are primarily medical
      data about real people.
    </p>
    <p>
      An EEG is very complex to read, especially because of noise, and
      because the biomarkers are very tiny patterns. Even if we had
      such an EEG, the merits of slam would be forgotten as the
      clinicians would debate about whether the biomarkers is present
      or not.
    </p>
    <h1>Generating a toy EEG</h1>
    <p>
      I think the time has come to generate a comically-simple EEG. To
      avoid debates, it will last for 20 seconds. The background of
      the EEG will be sine waves with a frequency of 0.9 Hz, and an
      amplitude of 15 μV.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between seconds 10 and 15, there will be a "movement artifact",
      and by that we mean that the signal will be multiplied by 5
      during that period of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, a few <em>pointes</em> and <em>encoches</em> will be
      sprinkled here and there: pointes at seconds 2, 3 and 16 on O2,
      at time 7 on O1, and encoches at seconds 4 and 5 on Fp1, 18 on
      Fp2.
    </p>
    <h2>What is a pointe?</h2>
    <p>
      This biomarker is a 0.1-second spike of -20 μV. We model it by a
      triangle with a peak at 0.05 seconds.
    </p>
    <h2>What is an encoche?</h2>
    <p>
      This is a simple polygon that lasts for 0.4 seconds. It starts
      at 0 V, then at 0.1 seconds it is 20 μV, at 0.3 seconds it jumps
      to -20 μV, and finally at 0.4 seconds it is back to 0 V.
